# Audio Splitter

Simple audio splitter: split any audio file into same-length chunks.

Uses ffmpeg under the hood, so make sure you have it installed and it's available in your path. 

It can also normalize audio volume using the `speechnorm` filter.

I mostly use this to split audiobooks into chunks for listening while swimming. You can read more about it here: https://www.tomups.com/posts/swimming-and-audiobooks/
